We were supposed to create a function to see if the forces of good or evil would win in a battle depending on how many of each type of species there were and each species had different point values for how powerful they were. In lecture we learned about relationships in a database. we talked about the one to one, one to many, and many to many. I feel like the lecture was about a many to many relationship with 2 intermediaries between the two main relationships. Our project in the afternoon was to create relationships between solar systems, stars, planets, moons, species. So, each level you would go deeper you would have more relationships defined in the child, if you wanted the child to have relationships with its grandparents or great grandparents. And if we got far enough we would work on species which became a many to many relationship. Her is a link to my github showing the code.
