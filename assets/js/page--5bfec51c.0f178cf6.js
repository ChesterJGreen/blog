We got into groups and figured out how where a person walking so many blocks and turning right or left and then walking so many blocks ends up. The process was interesting because we basically had each person represent a function without knowing it. We had one person record and do the math, one person kept track of which direction the person would be going (translating directions from left/right to north/south/east/west), and the final person was relaying the information to the group. Our group finished first. The computation took so long that we didn't try checking our work because it would have made us take the longest to finish. we were within 14 blocks of the total. Our lecture consisted of creating an art terminal where art projects were displayed. Grouping together projects by the same user.
